    <h2>Paul Shields</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Paul Shields. I'm from Thousand Oaks, California, and I'm majoring in Software Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>My hobbies and pastimes include video games, listening to music, and reading. I am one of approximately 13 siblings, and I recently returned from the Florida Tampa Mission.</p>
    <p>I love the environment on campus at BYU-I. Even in the most practical classes, the Holy Ghost can be present to teach the truth, and the faculty are all dedicated to the success</p>
    <p>and welfare of the students.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church all my life. I love all the standard works and I have proficient command of several verses and chapters, having been blessed with a strong</p>
    <p>memory for words and sentence structure. If I had to pick a favorite, I'd have to say Helaman 3:29-30.</p>
