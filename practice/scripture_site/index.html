            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints currently recognizes four books of scripture in an open canon: the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Each is a volume of holy writ intended to fill our souls with faith and draw us closer to our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Each has unique characteristics that warrant extended and individual study, several of which are explained on this site.
