            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints currently recognizes four books of scripture in an open canon: the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Each is a volume of holy writ intended to fill our souls with faith and draw us closer to our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Each has unique characteristics that warrant extended and individual study, several of which are explained on this site.

            When God needs to deliver a message to mankind, he does so by calling a prophet. Scriptures are written records of God's dealings with people as chronicled by the prophets of their day. 2 Peter puts it thus: "prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1:21). Elsewhere in latter-day revelation, the Lord said concerning the Elders of the Church: "And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation" (D&C 68:4).

            To put it bluntly and simply, the concept of scriptural inerrancy is totally rejected by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe that in choosing to speak through mortal beings such as prophets and apostles, the Lord has foregone perfection in the recording of scripture. The notion common in Christendom at large that scripture is flawless and inerrant is not consistent even within the Bible alone. Because many issues change between generations, we prize the words of a living prophet who can speak for God now, and not just the voices of ancient prophets, speaking as they do from the dust.
