            The Holy Bible is a record of scripture that gives an account of some of God's dealings with mankind, from the Creation process to approximately the end of the first century A.D. The word "Bible" is an anglicized form of the Greek word "biblia," meaning "books." As the name may suggest, the Bible is an collection the writings of several different prophets, beginning with the five books of Moses and ending with the Revelation of Saint John the Divine.

            The Eighth Article of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints states that "We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God." Latter-day Saints use the King James Version of the Bible.

            There are two primary divisions: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament contains prophecies and history of the people of Israel prior to the advent of Jesus Christ, and the New Testament is a collection of accounts of the Lord's mortal ministry, as well as epistles and prophecies from some of the early apostles of the Church.
