        Intro and Basics
        </p>
        <p>
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints currently recognizes four books of scripture in an open canon: the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Each is a volume of holy writ intended to fill our souls with faith and draw us closer to our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Each has unique characteristics that warrant extended and individual study, several of which are explained on this site.

        Prophets
        </p>
        <p>
        When God needs to deliver a message to mankind, he does so by calling a prophet. Scriptures are written records of God's dealings with people as chronicled by the prophets of their day. 2 Peter puts it thus: "prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1:21). Elsewhere in latter-day revelation, the Lord said concerning the Elders of the Church: "And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation" (D&C 68:4).
        </p>
        <p>
        Inerrancy
      </p>
      <p>
      To put it bluntly and simply, the concept of scriptural inerrancy is totally rejected by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe that in choosing to speak through mortal beings such as prophets and apostles, the Lord has foregone perfection in the recording of scripture. The notion common in Christendom at large that scripture is flawless and inerrant is not consistent even within the Bible alone. Because many issues change between generations, we prize the words of a living prophet who can speak for God now, and not just the voices of ancient prophets, speaking as they do from the dust.

      <h3>The Holy Bible</h3>
      <p>
      The Holy Bible is a record of scripture that gives an account of some of God's dealings with mankind, from the Creation process to approximately the end of the first century A.D. The word "Bible" is an anglicized form of the Greek word "biblia," meaning "books." As the name may suggest, the Bible is an collection the writings of several different prophets, beginning with the five books of Moses and ending with the Revelation of Saint John the Divine. The Eighth Article of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints states that "We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God." Latter-day Saints use the King James Version of the Bible. There are two primary divisions: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament contains prophecies and history of the people of Israel prior to the advent of Jesus Christ, and the New Testament is a collection of accounts of the Lord's mortal ministry, as well as epistles and prophecies from some of the early apostles of the Church.

      <h3>The Book of Mormon</h3>
      <p>
        The Book of Mormon is a record of scripture that details the journey of a group of Israelites who, through the intervention of God, escaped Jerusalem before its ransacking at the hands of Babylon. This group follows the Lord's guidance to make their way across the sea to the American continent, circa 591-589 B.C., from which point the emigrants develop a civilization and divide themselves into two primary divisions: Nephites and Lamanites. They kept records for the space of approximately 1000 years, until the Lamanites overpowered and wiped out the Nephites. In like manner to the Bible, the Book of Mormon contains teachings from several prophets who delivered their messages to the people in varying times and circumstances. Among the most unique and powerful aspects of the Book of Mormon is its clear witness of Jesus Christ, teaching clearly the doctrine of Christ and the clear knowledge among ancient peoples of the advent and Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. Its most significant event is the appearance of the risen Lord to the Nephites shortly following His resurrection.
